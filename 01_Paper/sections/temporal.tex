\begin{outline}

Transition frequencies/probabilities

Evolution of different types of malfunctioning pixels separately

Usage data analysis

Intermediate discussion

+ Introduce more detailed set of categories here to assess severity of defect (better to track progress)

+ Change in rate of occurrence of each bad pixel type over time: constant over all subpanels?

+ Change in gradient over subpanels

+ Change in feature size: \\ \-\ do clusters grow gradually over time, or do they simply appear suddenly?\\ \-\ Track new clusters as they appear \& study progress.

+ Change in shape of response over time (spot model across each image set)

+ How rapidly do new dead pixels occur? Can we recommend how often a new bad pixel map should be created?
