All of the detector images used in the study were cropped to some degree. However, all images are taken from a panel of the same dimensions (2048 pixels square, consisting of two rows of 16 subpanels, each of 128 $\times$ 1024 pixels). For ease of visual comparison, all images have been padded to a $2048 \times 2048$ square so that they all occupy their true position, relative to the detector edges, within the plot area.
