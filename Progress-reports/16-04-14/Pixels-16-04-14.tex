\subsection*{Quick notes}

\begin{itemize}

\item
Black images on 15-01-08 are somehow corrupted: First and last 10 images are identical (as in \texttt{all(b.150108[ , , 1] == b.150108[ , , 2]) == T, all(b.150108[ , , 11] == b.150108[ , , 12]) == T}. As a result, 14470pts have SD = 0; gives such a low mean SD that model fitting is meaningless.
 
\item Tried fitting different shapes (hyper-ellipses, including ellipse and squircle). Improvement in residual MAD/SD after panel fitting is very slight in recent images. However, suspect that in old data, spot veers closer to square, so might be useful to allow $n$ to vary with the data.

\item Fitted mini-panels: no major change to MAD and SD of residuals, but spatial distribution differs. Think this is over-fitting: edge panels on grey \& white are `tipped up' by low values along panel border, so values around row 512 are too low. Better to fit a more sophisticated spot or panel model.

\item Found another line of warm pixels: black image 14-10-09, panel L7, col 43 = [809,1:992,"black", 141009]

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Current questions/considerations}
\begin{itemize}

\item Still more work needed on appropriate threshold setting (\& justification thereof) for bad SD. Applying same limit as for residuals picks up large numbers of apparently normal pixels.

\item Need to make clear that we cannot expect to get a perfectly-fitting model. If the panels were behaving perfectly as expected then residuals should follow distribution exactly (Johnson accounts for skew/kurtosis due to movement of mean level within finite space) - but since the distribution is bounded, we will always have clusters of high/low values, as pixels `drift' to the extremes.

\item Goodness of fit tests are meaningless for same reason: our null hypothesis expects large numbers of pixels at extremes. With such a large sample size, a small number of these extreme values will cause GoF tests to fail (could test sensitivity if necessary)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Tracking development of bad pixels over time}

Parametric model used: circular spot fitted by linear regression of value against distance from centre $z$ and $z^2$, panels fitted by linear regression over $x$, $x^2$, $y$, $y^2$ with interactions (most complex model currently considered for panel fitting). A Johnson distribution was fitted to the residuals for each image, with points $< Q_{0.001}$ labelled as \texttt{dim} and points $> Q_{0.999}$ labelled as \texttt{bright}. A Johnson distribution was fitted separately to the pixelwise SD for each image, with points $< Q_{0.0001}$ labelled as \texttt{quiet} and those $> Q_{0.9999}$ as \texttt{noisy}.
