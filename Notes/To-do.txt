Use robust estimators, not just SD: SD too susceptible to outliers.
    - SD is fine for pixelwise fluctuation: we want to be susceptible to outliers
    - measure of dispersion of majority of points: MAD
    - more efficient alternatives: absolute pairwise differences, biweight midvariance.
    
Try removing oscillation from dark current (per-channel) - what is remaining pixelwise/global SD?
    - mean pixelwise SD is v low in black images - compare to other image batches
    
Compare bad pixel maps etc from Jay to figures obtained manually

Test for whole-panel offset on each date: what is per-pixel change over time?
    - from initial plots, seems to vary from panel to panel
    - try adjusting absolute value using central point(s) as locus
        - perhaps take mean of clusters of points from central 4 panels (s/b stable)
        - already tried linear regression over X and Y coordinates
        - Linear regression over pixel distance from amplifier: compare results to XY regression

Spot visible in black channel - why? Thought this related to source, which is switched off here.
    - spot in black channel is lower in value, while spot in white/grey is higher
    - are we looking at combination of two spots in grey/white channel?
    - is residual value related to mean/variance of absolute value at all?
    - model initially as function of distance from centre
    
Modelling the dark current by breaking into components
    - circular spot of lower values (assume bivariate Gaussian)
    - panelwise variation (assume linear over panel, starting in one corner)
    - characteristic 'standing wave' effect along columns
    - deviations from this pattern will be bad (non-standard) pixels
When source is added (grey/white channels), second spot in almost the same place
    - dark current is essentially thermal - any variation depending on time of year?
    
Panelwise fixed-pattern effect:
    - use Loess(?) with high smoothing parameter across each panel to obtain planar gradient
    - take locus as lowest corner of each panel
    - compare corner-to-corner gradients across panels: is pattern similar?
    - also get per-panel absolute offset (as well as image offset)
    - subtract this from overall dark current to get clearer view of spot offset
    - smooth image further by aligning each corner - if possible
    - compare gradients across all panels, all colours and all dates. How variable is this?
Also: spot damage/desensitisation in centre of image 

Recreate thresholding used in manual
    - characterise distribution of pixelwise mean & SD to identify useful thresholds
    - ask Jay to provide bad pixel maps as well as channel images next time
    - rework thresholding using black as offset image
    - more detail on calculation:
        - Perkin Elmer website may give calibration standard? (eg ISO____)
        - find ref. manual for Varian panel - may have similar calculation

Intra-panel dependency:
    - check relationship between mean and variance, per-panel. Should be linear?
    - plot residuals - any patterns?

Image correction: should we simply be subtracting black channel from white channel?

Standing wave pattern in sensor?
    - how to test residuals for consistency along panel: 
        - test for same distribution in different regions
        - resampling/bootstrap
        - summarise using mean/median/SD in blocks (eg 8 x 124-pixel runs)
    - how to characterise wave? Is there a package that will give frequency & amplitude?
        - use acf/pacf to check periodicity. Need to look into differences. Also ccf and fft.
    - do signs of differences generally go same way?
        - check Medical Stats notes - may be something in there (like Wilcoxon?)
    - correlation of adjacent differences? (column-wise & row-wise)
    - re mechanism:
        - standing wave in CMOS/CCD sensors
        - stop looking for 'noise' terms: it's systematic!
    - should any deviation from normal oscillation be termed a bad pixel?
      (even if value falls within range of oscillation)
        - what do those pixels do in the white & grey batches?

Look again at diff-SD: where SD across acquisitions differs (ie. at edges of panels), what is pattern of difference? Erratic oscillation, varying amplitude, or switching of signs?
    - consider SD of absolute differences to remove sign-switching problem
Identifying per-channel offset in dark current:
    - can per-channel offset be broken into image offset & channel offset?
    - initially use points with low oscillation SD to give 'fixed-pattern noise'
    - do differences between these points give a constant per-channel offset?
    - then extend to regions with less constant oscillation pattern

If using Lowess smoothing, need to understand more about theoretical underpinning

    - Review Julia's multiple testing notes/literature

    - Van Nieuwenhove et al on dynamic intensity normalisation
    
    - look into robust statistics: robust SD etc, for thresholding
