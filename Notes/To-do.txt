Break black channel image into components:
    - model circular spot (assume bivariate Gaussian)
    - model panelwise variation
    - model 'standing wave' effect in consecutive readings along columns

Create new set of plotting levels, based on IQR and more even distribution of values

Recreate thresholding used in manual
    - ask Jay to provide bad pixel maps as well as channel images next time
    - rework thresholding using black as offset image
    - more detail on calculation:
        - Perkin Elmer website may give calibration standard? (eg ISO____)
        - find ref. manual for Varian panel - may have similar calculation

Intra-panel dependency:
    - check relationship between mean and variance, per-panel. Should be linear?
    - plot residuals - any patterns?

Standing wave pattern in sensor?
    - how to characterise wave? Is there a package that will give frequency & amplitude?
        - use acf/pacf to check periodicity. Need to look into differences. Also ccf and fft.
    - do signs of differences generally go same way?
        - check Medical Stats notes - may be something in there (like Wilcoxon?)
    - correlation of adjacent differences? (column-wise & row-wise)
    - re mechanism:
        - standing wave in CMOS/CCD sensors
    - should also check for underlying periodicity in grey & white channels
    
Review Julia's multiple testing notes/literature

Try to characterise shape of mean & SD of all data - use as basis for statistical thresholding

If using Lowess smoothing, need to understand more about theoretical underpinning
