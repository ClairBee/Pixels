Spot visible in black channel - why? Thought this related to source, which is switched off here.
    - spot in black channel is lower in value, while spot in white/grey is higher
    - are we looking at combination of two spots in grey/white channel?
    - is residual value related to mean/variance of absolute value at all?
    
Modelling the dark current by breaking into components
    - circular spot of lower values (assume bivariate Gaussian)
    - panelwise variation (assume linear over panel, starting in one corner)
    - characteristic 'standing wave' effect along columns
    - deviations from this pattern will be bad (non-standard) pixels
When source is added (grey/white channels), second spot in almost the same place

Recreate thresholding used in manual
    - ask Jay to provide bad pixel maps as well as channel images next time
    - rework thresholding using black as offset image
    - more detail on calculation:
        - Perkin Elmer website may give calibration standard? (eg ISO____)
        - find ref. manual for Varian panel - may have similar calculation

Intra-panel dependency:
    - check relationship between mean and variance, per-panel. Should be linear?
    - plot residuals - any patterns?

Image correction: should we simply be subtracting black channel from white channel?

Standing wave pattern in sensor?
    - how to test residuals for consistency along panel: 
        - test for same distribution in different regions
        - resampling/bootstrap
        - summarise using mean/median/SD in blocks (eg 8 x 124-pixel runs)
    - how to characterise wave? Is there a package that will give frequency & amplitude?
        - use acf/pacf to check periodicity. Need to look into differences. Also ccf and fft.
    - do signs of differences generally go same way?
        - check Medical Stats notes - may be something in there (like Wilcoxon?)
    - correlation of adjacent differences? (column-wise & row-wise)
    - re mechanism:
        - standing wave in CMOS/CCD sensors

Try to characterise shape of mean & SD of all data - use as basis for statistical thresholding

If using Lowess smoothing, need to understand more about theoretical underpinning
