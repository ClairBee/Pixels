AIM TO COMPLETE BY THURSDAY 29TH SEPTEMBER:

    . write up thresholding (variables used)
        . linear response
        . Gaussian spot response

    . code bad pixel detection, get bad pixel map for all images
    
    . code feature detection
        . lines
        . clusters
        . dense regions
        
    . rework dense feature detection to ignore lines (need to do this before rows/columns)
    . also need to rework to pick up double/triple columns
    . and to enumerate numbers of features automatically 
        
    o write up feature detection
        . screen spots
        . lines
        . clusters
        o dense regions
        
    o write functions for spatial analysis
    o check aggregation with and without cluster bodies (in cropped image)
    o quadrat tests to check subpanel, vertical & horizontal homogeneity
    o F, G and K-functions with and without IPP fitted: check for CSR beyond inhomogeneity
        o any patterns in inhomogeneity across distinct images?
        o 
    
    o produce R script to run report
        o also include power settings & mean value obtained (overall & in central region)
        o counts of features identified
        o evaluate damage in central region (as in manual) vs over whole detector

NEXT STEPS:

    + PREP CODE TO CONVERT & ASSESS NEW IMAGES
    
    + could include discussion of expected distribution of each variable?
    
    + compare each variable with shading-corrected values. Where do problems arise?
    
    + spatial assessment of distribution of pixel defects
        + quadrat tests, G-functions, F-functions, K-functions
        + with and without clustered features
        
    + specify areas most affected by dense regions (always attached to an edge?)
    
    + persistence/progression of defects
