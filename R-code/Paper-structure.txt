Possible structure for final write-up

· general introduction to image acquisition process & data

· literature review (probably quite brief, since mostly patents, so not very much in PD.)
    · refer to Hubble similarities & differences
    · comment on generally applicability to any CCD device

· describe panel structure & difference in behaviour (variability & response) across subpanels
    · mention possibility of linear gradient model + circular spot as parametric approach
    
· definitions of defective pixels
    · mention different levels of stringency depending on process type 
      (CT reconstruction vs static image, correction vs assessment of detector)
    · relate to original thresholds in manual

· spatial distribution of defective pixels
    · are some types of defect more likely to occur in certain regions than others?
    (where is the most dangerous place for a pixel to be?)
    
· describe specific features: lines, clusters, singletons

· state spaces of individual defective pixels, with transition rates
    · hopefully link transition rates to detector usage using .xtec files
    
· state spaces of features (lines, superclusters, singletons)

· behaviour of each defective pixel type/feature type under shading correction
    · how severe does a defect need to be to remain after correction?

· apply method to old data as well as new (discuss effect on threshold selection?)

What is the purpose of the paper?
    - are we looking to describe a methodology to assess the state of the screen?
    - or just to describe observed features?
