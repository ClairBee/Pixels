# true state 1 at their first observation. If someone starts in a much higher state, this may result
# in an infinite log-likelihood, and changing initprobs would be sensible.

# To compare the relative fit of two nested models, it is easy to compare their likelihoods. However 
# it is not always easy to determine how well a fitted multi-state model describes an irregularly-observed
# process. Ideally we would like to compare observed data with fitted or expected data under the model. 
# If there were times at which all individuals were observed then the fit of the expected numbers 
# in each state (or prevalences) can be assessed directly at those times.
