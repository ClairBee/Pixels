\addfigure{What kind of features appear only in the grey images, not in the black? Clusters etc are usually offset defects (eg. just as bright in the black images), so should appear in black images as well. Can we propose a more efficient classification method, based on where the most severe features occur? (eg. discard global-uniformity criteria because it is covered by local non-uniformity)}

\addfigure{Note that lagging pixels are not included in this study - would be a useful addition. However, can we reason that lagging pixels will cause a `tail' of values as charge is deferred? Can we get the lag-test data, to see which pixels have that problem \& to see how they appear in the images we have?}
