\section{Temporal analysis}
%----------------------------------------------------
\begin{outline}

Transition frequencies/probabilities

+ short-term persistence: what \% of px in one image are still there in the next?\\
+ of those that persist, what \% persist for a third image?

Evolution of different types of malfunctioning pixels separately

Usage data analysis

Intermediate discussion

+ Introduce more detailed set of categories here to assess severity of defect (better to track progress)

+ Change in rate of occurrence of each bad pixel type over time: constant over all subpanels?

+ Change in feature size: \\ \-\ do clusters grow gradually over time, or do they simply appear suddenly?\\ \-\ Track new clusters as they appear \& study progress.

+ Can we relate this to change in shape of response over time (spot model across each image set)

+ How rapidly do new dead pixels occur? Can we recommend how often a new bad pixel map should be created?
\end{outline}

\addfigure{Focus should probably be on short-term persistence of pixels: of features identified now, how many are likely to persist into next image? Don't want to over-specify to the single panel for which we have a lengthy sequence of images (although, maybe include as case study?)}
